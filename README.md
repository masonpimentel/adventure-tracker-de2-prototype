Notes on project management:

1. Because there are many generated files in Quartus, we should just delete our local copies and re-clone the entire repo.

2. I added software/ to the .gitignore so that there is no overlap when we push our changes to the files we have locally for Eclipse. So when we pull the repo, there won't be project files with the same name already there.
